# What does this do?

This React app is just a quick little Tarokka Deck Reader that I threw together for a run of Curse of Strahd with some friends

# Where can I find the meanings for these cards?

I highly recommend purchasing the Curse of Strahd adventure path. If you prefer digital books, you can
find it on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/adventures/curse-of-strahd">D&D Beyond</a>

# Can you implement my idea?

If I get enough requests, I may add something new, but due to Tarokka Reading being such a quick
portion of Curse of Strahd, I don't know that anything more than what is here is needed!
